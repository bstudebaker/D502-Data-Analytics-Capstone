# Dashboard Directory

This folder contains visual assets related to the Tableau Story dashboard created for the D502 Data Analytics Capstone project, *An Analysis of Airline Performance: January 2023 – June 2025*. These images provide evidence of the dashboard design, KPI communication, and data storytelling used in the final presentation.

### Dashboard Visuals
- **monthly_delay_rate.png**  
  Displays the overall monthly delay rate across all U.S. carriers from January 2023 through June 2025. This visualization highlights seasonal patterns, operational variability, and long‑term performance trends.

- **monthly_delay_rate_delayed_flight.png**  
  Shows the average delay minutes for flights that were delayed each month. This KPI helps quantify the operational impact of delays and supports practical significance discussions.

- **top5_carrier_delay_rate.png**  
  Compares monthly delay rates for the top five carriers by flight volume. This visualization reinforces the chi‑square findings by illustrating which airlines consistently experience higher delay rates over time.

## Purpose
These dashboard images serve as evidence of the Tableau Story used in the capstone project. They demonstrate the visual communication of KPIs, comparative performance across carriers, and the integration of statistical findings into an accessible, narrative‑driven format.

The full interactive Tableau Story can be accessed at the link provided in the project‑level README.
